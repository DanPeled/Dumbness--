# Running a code file
To run a code file, use whatever file extension you want,
run the file using ```run(filepath)```
# Hello World
the print function prints
```py
print("Hello World")
```
# Variables
vars are made using the `var` keyword
```py
var number = 4
print(number)
```
# Comments
comments are only one-lined and created using th `#` keyword
```py
# This is a comment
```
# Functions
functions are defined using the `fun` keyword and their code is started with a `->` as diffrent from `:` in python and `{` and other languages
```py
code:
fun why() -> print("why")
why()
output:
why
```
function params are used the same way as in python:
```py
code:
fun egg(text) -> print("egg " + text)
egg("yolk")
output:
egg yolk
```
# Loops
loops are used with either `for <varriable> = <starting value> to <limit> do <code> enddo` or `while <expression> do <code> enddo
```py
code :
for i = 0 to 3 do
print("EGG YOLK")
enddo

output :
EGG YOLK
EGG YOLK
EGG YOLK
```
